This directory contains a namelist file for WPS that specifies the center coordinates, time frame, and domain information for the WRF-Fire simulations in this study.

It also includes R files that were used to generate the scenario of one more windy day by copying meteorological information from the control simulation and writing over the time stamps to create the experimental conditions.
